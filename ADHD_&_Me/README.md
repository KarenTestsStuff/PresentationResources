## ADHD & Me: How neurodivergence serves my testing

### Abstract:

Brains are weird, neat, squishy things. Mine has been diagnosed with things like ADHD, anxiety, and depression, with a list of common behaviors that go along with it. To some people, this might sound like terrible news. But, I have a different take on my particular collection of mental conditions. I can use pieces of my experience living with them, and turn them into useful tools.

When looking at the challenges that I face as a software tester, I want to present you with some examples of how neurodivergence can be harnessed to work for me - instead of against me. Come listen to these stories of how these mental powers help boost my curiosity, empathy, and effectiveness. You may just learn something about your own brain along the way.

My squad who helps me in the fight for software quality justice:

- ADHD inspires in me a curiosity to dig below the surface
- Anxiety helps me to empathize with user experience
- Depression/manic cycles train me to use my energy wisely, at the right time
