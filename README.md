### Community Experience:
I began speaking by doing a 99 second talk at a Ministry of Testing TestBash event, to thank the organizers for their efforts to bring us important discussions. Once I realized the power of the community we have around us in testing, I knew I had to share us with the world. This inspiration drives my heart for service in my communities. Below is a selection of events I have been involved with.
